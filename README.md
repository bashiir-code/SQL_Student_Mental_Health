# SQL_Student_Mental_Health

Introduction
--
Studying in a foreign country is simultaneously thrilling and demanding. What factors, precisely, are responsible for the appeal of this project? To find the main aspects that influence the mental health of international students, I will examine the data provided by a Japanese university. Through data manipulation, I plan to see the patterns and trends that point to the most influential factors in students' mental health. By looking at the factors like academic pressure, social integration, financial stress, and cultural adjustment, I believe that insights into what exactly affects their mental health will be gained. Let's take a deep look into the data, and try to find some answers!
